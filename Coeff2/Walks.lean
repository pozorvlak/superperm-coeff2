# Walks in the proper overlap graph, `Λ(n)`, superpermutations, `S(n)` (paper §2)

Formalization choices:
* A walk `W = (π₁,…,π_m)` is a nonempty list of permutation words in which consecutive
  words are joined by proper edges.  Walk *times* are 0-based here (`vert 0 = π₁`);
  the paper is 1-based.
* `vert t` is total, with junk value `[]` past the end of the walk.
* `Λ(n)` and `S(n)` are `Nat.sInf`s of the corresponding sets of lengths.
